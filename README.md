Limitations:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not possible to download several single videos or several lecture series in a single execution of the script.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not possible to download just the newly added videos from a lecture series.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not possible to view the download progress.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not possible to continue canceled downloads.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not possible to save the downloaded videos into another directory.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not possible to save already used passphrases to a file and try to use them next time automatically.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will adress some of these limitations in the future.
  
Dependencies:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;curl, getopts, md5sum, stat, grep, sed, head, cat, tac, ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All used commands and programs should already be available in every linux environment. It's also possible to run  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this script under Windows inside the Cygwin terminal.  
  
Optinal Dependencies:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;ffmpeg  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ffmpeg is needed to extract the audio track from the video file. You don't need to install ffmpeg unless you want to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use this feature.  
  
About:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;l2gDownloader has been developed in October/November 2016. It's working for almost any video at the moment,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;however this might change over time. If you're experiencing problems, please contact me (include url), maybe I will  
&nbsp;&nbsp;fix it.
